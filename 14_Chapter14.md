Sure, I would be happy to explain the code used to resolve the image in the chapter about cat flying.

To add images to a markdown file, we use an `img` tag with the `src` attribute set to the path of the image file. Here's an example syntax:

```
<img src="image_file_path">
```

To add an image of a cat flying in the sky, we can save the image file in the same directory as the markdown file and use the following code snippet:

```
<img src="cat_flying.jpg" alt="Cat flying in the sky">
```

In this example, we named the image file `cat_flying.jpg`. The `alt` attribute is used to provide a text description of the image for users who cannot see the image or have screen readers. 

You can further customize the display of the image by adding the `width` and `height` attributes to adjust the dimensions of the image:

```
<img src="cat_flying.jpg" alt="Cat flying in the sky" width="500" height="300">
```

Here, we set the width and height of the image to 500 pixels and 300 pixels respectively. 

Overall, adding images to markdown files is easy with the `img` tag, and it can greatly enhance the educational and engaging nature of the content.
