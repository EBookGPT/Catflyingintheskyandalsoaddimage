To embed images in our GitHub markdown document, we can use the following syntax:

```
![alt text](image_url)
```

The `alt text` is a short description of the image that appears if the image fails to load, while `image_url` is the URL of the image that is to be displayed. It's essential to ensure that the `image_url` is a valid link that points to the image's location. 

Suppose you have an image named "cat_flying.jpg" stored in a local folder named "images". The code to include this image in your markdown document would look like this:

```
![cat flying](images/cat_flying.jpg)
```

This code will display the image of a cat flying with the "cat flying" text as its alternate text description. It's important to note that the relative path to the folder must be specified correctly to display local images correctly. 

When embedding images, it's crucial to keep file size and resolution in mind. Large images can slow down the document's loading speed and take up extra storage space. Hence, it is recommended to optimize the image size and resolution before embedding them into the document.
