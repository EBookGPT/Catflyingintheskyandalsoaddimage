**Chapter 17: Conclusion**

Congratulations! If you've made it all the way to the end of this book, you now have a wealth of knowledge about the incredible world of cat flying. We hope this book has taken you on an exciting journey through the history, anatomy, aerodynamics, training, and performance metrics of these furry pilots.

We've explored the challenges and rewards of training a cat to fly, and the important safety precautions you should always keep in mind when taking to the skies. We've discussed weather considerations, flying in different environments, and the legal landscape surrounding cat flying.

But the journey doesn't end here. As we've touched on in previous chapters, the future of cat flying is bright and constantly evolving. With new technological advances and a growing community of cat pilots, there are endless possibilities for what these soaring felines can achieve.

So, grab your goggles and prepare for takeoff - the sky's the limit!

In order to add an image to our textbook chapter, we use the following code in Markdown format:

```
![alt text](image filename)
```

- The `alt text` is used to provide a description of the image for accessibility purposes.
- The `image filename` refers to the name and file type of the image that we want to display.

For example, let's say we have an image named `cat-flying.jpg` that we want to include in our 'Anatomy of a Flying Cat' chapter. We would use the following code:

```markdown
![Cat flying in the sky](cat-flying.jpg)
```

This would display the image centered on the page with the alt text "Cat flying in the sky". By adjusting the filename and alt text values in the code, we can easily add an image to any section of our textbook.
