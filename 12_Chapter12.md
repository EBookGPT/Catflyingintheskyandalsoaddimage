To display an image of a flying cat in this chapter, we use an HTML code snippet in Markdown format. The code is as follows:

`<img src="https://i.imgur.com/luVFMyL.gif" alt="Flying cat" height="300">`

Here, we are using the `img` tag to display the image of a flying cat. The `src` attribute is set to the URL of the image file, which in this case is "https://i.imgur.com/luVFMyL.gif". The `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image for screen readers and in case the image fails to load.

Additionally, we have set the height attribute to 300 pixels to control the height of the displayed image. This value can be adjusted as needed to fit your document's formatting requirements.

By using this HTML code snippet, we can add an engaging and relevant visual element to our chapter on flying cats.
